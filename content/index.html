<p>Apache Flume 1.2.0 is the third release under the auspices of Apache of the
so-called &#8220;NG&#8221; codeline, and our first release as a top-level Apache
project! Flume 1.2.0 has been put through many stress and regression tests,
is stable, production-ready software, and is backwards-compatible with
Flume 1.1.0.</p>
<p>Four months of very active development went into this release: a whopping
192 patches were committed since 1.1.0, representing many features,
enhancements, and bug fixes. While the full change log can be found in the
link below, here are a few new feature highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>New durable file channel</li>
<li>New client API</li>
<li>New HBase sinks (two different implementations)</li>
<li>New Interceptor interface (a plugin processing API)</li>
<li>New JMX-based monitoring support</li>
</ul>
