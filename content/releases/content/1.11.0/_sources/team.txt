Team
====
 A successful project requires many people to play many different roles. Some members write code or documentation,
 while others are valuable as testers, submitting patches and suggestions.

 The team is comprised of Members, Committers and Contributors. Members are responsible for making project management
 decisions, voting on releases as well as acting as Committers. Committers have direct access to the source code and
 actively evolve the codebase. Contributors improve the project through submission of patches and suggestions
 to the Members. The number of Contributors to the project is unbounded. Get involved today. All contributions
 to the project are greatly appreciated.

 The following individuals are recognized as currently active PMC Members or Project Committers.
