It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or SHA512 signatures. Please read
`Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases <https://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html>`_ for more information on
why you should verify our releases.

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the `KEYS <https://www.apache.org/dist/flume/KEYS>`_
as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files from the
`main distribution directory <https://www.apache.org/dist/flume/>`_ rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using::

    % gpg --import KEYS
    % gpg --verify apache-flume-1.11.0-src.tar.gz.asc

Apache Flume 1.11.0 is signed by Ralph Goers B3D8E1BA

In addition, you can verify the SHA512 checksum on the files. A Unix program called sha or sha512sum is included in
many Unix distributions. Note that verifying the checksum is unnecessary if the PGP signature has been validated.

.. rubric:: Previous_Releases

All previous releases of Apache Flume can be found in the `archive repository <https://archive.apache.org/dist/flume>`_.
